# CRUD Business Directory App with MERN and Redux

This repository contains a complete code to a simple business directory CRUD( Create.Read.Update.Delete ) app with MERN( MongoDB.ExpressJS.React.NodeJS ) stack and Redux.

* It uses Bootstrap for the look ( and feel ) and responsiveness. 
* I have also used Formik and Yup to validate the form prior to submitting/inserting the fields into MongoDb. 

Here is a [Demo](https://sleepy-temple-88047.herokuapp.com/) hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

## Run it locally

Ensure that node, npm (or yarn), and mongod server are installed on your local machine.

Clone this repo to your machine - _git clone https://github.com/teddynted/mern-crud-with-redux.git_, cd into the directory and run ***npm run start***.
